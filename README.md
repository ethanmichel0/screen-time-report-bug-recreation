Ios version of my iphone: 18.6.2
xcode version tested on: 26.1
Details: I can't access DeviceActivityReportExtension. This repo reproduces an issue I was having. I am not actually seeing a screentime report anywhere. If anyone can help me view even a basic
report that woudl be super helpful. DeviceActivityMonitor extension is working fine for me in my other project (my main one, this is just reproducing).
